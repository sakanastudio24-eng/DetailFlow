- Identity key: `normalized(customer.email) + normalized(customer.phone)`.
- Day key timezone: `BOOKING_LIMIT_TIMEZONE` (default `America/Los_Angeles`).

## Vehicle Counting

- `vehicles[].size`: `small|medium|large`.
- `vehicles[].serviceIds`: must be supported package/add-on IDs.
- Selected-service vehicle count must be `<= 3`.

## Bot / Abuse Guards
- Honeypot filled: returns accepted and skips persistence/email.
- Rate-limit hook exists (placeholder for per-IP throttling).

## Email Pipeline Rules
- Owner email: always attempted for accepted bookings.

- Email failures: logged to `data/email_failures.json`.
- Booking persistence remains non-blocking on email send failures.

## UI Behavior (Booking Page)
